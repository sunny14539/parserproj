# Parser Project
This project is a syntactical analysis for the made up language RAT18S, with specific grammar rules.  
To compile the program, enter the following command into the terminal  
`g++ -std=c++17 parser.cpp -o parser`  
and to run the program, enter    
`./parser`  
The program reads from a file called `output.txt`, and if the executable does not display an output, there are no syntactical errors. Otherwise, it should output an error message indicating the rule it failed.
